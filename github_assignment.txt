The Foialawya repository was very interesting to me.
Here is the link to the repository: https://github.com/newsdev/foialawya
I think that this is a really cool app, that is helpful specifically for journalists.
It is basically a FOIA reminder for journalists so that they know when something is overdue, and what needs to be done next.
I am not really sure as to how it works, but it is used within another program called Django.
I like how this is something practical for all journalists as well, not just something that experienced coders would want to use.
One obvious limitation would be the ease of use.
I haven't tried to use it, because I don't really know how.
There is a pretty detailed explanation on the repository, however it is not detailed enough for us coding novices.
One improvement for this would probably be making the description more accessible for us journalists who are still learning code, or have never used code before.
It also looks like it is not specifically for one journalist to use at a time, but a managing system that a team/newsroom uses so that they do not duplicate FOIA requests.
This app looks like it can really help to streamline the FOIA waiting process and I am curious as to how many newsrooms use some kind of app specifically for tracking FOIAs.
Another aspect is that it allows the newsroom lawyer to have access as well, which allows them to be on top of when a lawsuit over a request needs to be submitted.
